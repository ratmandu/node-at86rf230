<h1>AT86RF230 Module for Node.js</h1>

<b>Here be dragons</b>

This is a work in progress.
This will likely not work for you at this point.
If you want to try it out, go for it.
Theres really no documentation yet.
You should really just come back later.
Go ahead and try it if you want, but it will probably break something you really enjoy.
Or it might not.
Who knows.
But your cat will be incredibly annoyed...


Seriously, this is a bad work in progress, though I will be cleaning it up as I go along, and adding features to actually make it useful.
